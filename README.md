# Catalog of Datasets for Ancient Latin Translation

This repository provides a curated collection of datasets designed to assist researchers, linguists, and developers in translating Ancient Latin texts. The datasets are aimed at improving machine learning models and natural language processing (NLP) applications focused on Latin, one of the foundational languages of classical literature, philosophy, and historical texts.

The goal of this repository is to centralize high-quality data resources that can be used for tasks such as Latin-to-English translation, syntactic analysis, and vocabulary enhancement. Whether you are working on developing translation tools, conducting linguistic studies, or exploring new AI techniques in classical languages, this catalog offers a valuable starting point.

Feel free to explore, contribute, or use these datasets for your projects, and don't hesitate to reach out for collaborations or inquiries.
